# Home Appliances Control Project
 
Project Description:You are required to build a small prototype for a 
mobile based home appliances control that satisfies what follows.
1- Develop a simple Android application to:
a- Control a 220 Volt lamp on/off (You shouldn’t delete the manual 
switch).
b- Control a plug on/off: If it’s off, No one can use the plug.
c- Display the door status.
d- Display Room Temperature.
e- Alarm if the temperature goes beyond a set value (Software Alarm 
+ Physical Alarm).
f- Save and show the times of opening and closing the door.
g- Announce using a speaker the action transmitted or received by the 
Application (ex: “The door is opened”, “Fire” if the temperature is 
too high, …etc).
2- Your components must be mounted on a suitable surface and 
wires should be hidden.
3- Develop your code with FRMD-KL25Z Arm processor-based board.
